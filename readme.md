# plotPlotR

**plotPlotR** referring to plot plotter is a package containing set of functions to create plots as segements or boundaries in a field experiment.

The functions are heavily based on the "**sf**" package and a little bit of dplyr and magrittr. The package provides functions that are simple for R users, who may not be familiar with spatial data or want functions that can be used easily, repeatedly.

The hope is this package will be update regularly and more functions are added.

## Installation

plotPlotR can be installed locally with `devtools::install_github("https://github.com/sin17m/plotplotr")`
